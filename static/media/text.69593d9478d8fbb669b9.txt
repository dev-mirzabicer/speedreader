BIDIRECTIONAL REPLICATION
Bidirectional replication was first convincingly demonstrated by experi- ments with some of the small bacterial viruses that infect E. coli. Bacteriophage lambda (phage ) contains a single linear molecule of DNA only 17.5 m long. The phage  chromosome is somewhat unusual in that it has a single-stranded region, 12 nucleotides long, at the 5 end of each complementary strand ( Figure 10.8). These single-stranded ends, called “cohesive” or “sticky” ends, are complementary to each other. The cohesive ends of a lambda chromosome can thus base-pair to form a hydrogen-bonded circular structure. One of the first events to occur after a lambda chromosome is injected into a host cell is its conver- sion to a covalently closed circular molecule (Figure 10.8). This conver- sion from the hydrogen-bonded circular form to the covalently closed circular form is catalyzed by DNA ligase, an important enzyme that seals single-strand breaks in DNA double helices. DNA ligase is required in all organisms for DNA replication, DNA repair, and recombination between DNA molecules. Like the E. coli chromosome, the lambda chro- mosome replicates in its circular form via -shaped intermediates.
The feature of the lambda chromosome that facilitated the demon- stration of bidirectional replication is its differentiation into regions con- taining high concentrations of adenine and thymine (AT-rich regions) and regions with large amounts of guanine and cytosine (GC-rich regions). In particular, it contains a few segments with high AT content (AT-rich clus- ters). In the late 1960s, Maria Schnös and Ross Inman used these AT-rich clusters as physical markers to demonstrate, by means of a technique called denaturation mapping, that replication of the lambda chromosome is initiated at a unique origin and proceeds bidirectionally rather than unidirectionally.
When DNA molecules are exposed to high temperature (100C) or high pH (11.4), the hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds that hold the complementary strands together in the double-helix configuration are broken, and the two strands separate—a process called denaturation. Because AT base pairs are held together by only two hydrogen bonds, compared with three hydrogen bonds in GC base pairs, AT-rich molecules denature more easily (at lower pH or temperature) than GC-rich molecules. When lambda chromosomes are exposed to pH 11.05 for 10 minutes under the appropri- ate conditions, the AT-rich clusters denature to form denaturation bubbles, which are detectable by electron microscopy, whereas the GC-rich regions remain in the duplex state ( Figure 10.9). These denaturation bubbles can be used as physical markers whether the lambda chromosome is in its mature linear form, its circular form, or its -shaped replicative intermediates. By examining the positions of the branch points (Y-shaped structures) relative to the positions of the denaturation bubbles in a large number of -shaped replicative intermediates, Schnös and Inman demonstrated that both branch points are replication forks that move in opposite directions around the circular chromosome.  Figure 10.10 shows the results expected in Schnös and Inman’s experiment if replication is (a) unidirectional or (b) bidirectional. The results clearly demonstrated that replication of the lambda chro- mosome is bidirectional.
Bidirectional replication from a fixed origin has also been demonstrated for several organisms with chromosomes that replicate as linear structures. Replication of the chromosome of phage T7, another small bacteriophage, begins at a unique site near one end to form an “eye” structure ( Figure 10.11a) and then proceeds bidirectionally until one fork reaches the nearest end. Replication of the Y-shaped structure ( Figure 10.11b) continues until the second fork reaches the other end of the molecule, producing two progeny chromosomes.
Replication of chromosomal DNA in eukaryotes is also bidirectional in those cases where it has been investigated. However, bidirectional replication is not univer- sal. The chromosome of coliphage P2, which replicates as a -shaped structure like the lambda chromosome, replicates unidirectionally from a unique origin.
DNA Replication in Prokaryotes
The results of studies of DNA replication by auto-
radiography and electron microscopy indicate that
the two progeny strands being synthesized at each
replicating fork are being extended in the same over-
all direction at the macromolecular level. Because the complementary strands of a double helix have opposite polarity, synthesis is occurring at the 5 end of one strand (3 → 5 extension) and the 3 end of the other strand (5 → 3 extension). However, the enzymes that catalyze the replication of DNA, DNA polymerases (see Focus on DNA Synthesis In Vitro), have an absolute requirement for a free 3-hydroxyl; they only carry out 5 → 3 synthesis ( Figure 10.12). These apparently contradictory results created an interesting paradox. For many years biochemists searched for new polymerases that could catalyze 3 → 5 synthesis. No such polymerase was ever found. Instead, experimental evidence has shown that all DNA synthesis occurs in the 5 → 3 direction.
Clearly, the mechanism of DNA replication must be more complex than researchers originally thought (see Figure 10.1). Given the absolute requirement of DNA polymerases for a free 3-OH on the primer strand, these enzymes cannot begin the synthesis of a new strand de novo. How is the synthesis of a new DNA strand initiated? Since the two parental strands of DNA must be unwound, we have to deal with the need for a swivel or an axis of rotation, especially for circular DNA molecules like the one present in the E. coli chromosome. Finally, how does the localized zone of strand separation or replication bubble form at the origin? These considerations and others indicate that DNA replication is more complicated than scientists thought when Watson and Crick proposed the semiconservative mechanism of replication in 1953.
DNA SYNTHESIS IN VITRO
Much has been learned about the molecular mechanisms involved in biological processes by disrupting cells, sepa- rating the various organelles, macromolecules, and other
components, and then reconstituting systems in the test tube, so-called in vitro systems that are capable of carrying out par- ticular metabolic events. Such in vitro systems can be dissected biochemically much more easily than in vivo systems, and, there- fore, they have contributed immensely to our understanding of biological processes. However, we should never assume that a phenomenon demonstrated in vitro occurs in vivo. Such an extra- polation should be made only when independent evidence from in vivo studies validates the results of the in vitro studies.
DNA replication is one area where in vitro studies have proven, and continue to prove, invaluable. Much of our knowledge about the process of DNA replication was initially deduced from such studies. In 1957, Arthur Kornberg and his coworkers were the first to dem- onstrate that DNA synthesis could occur in vitro. Kornberg received a Nobel Prize for this work just two years later (1959), which dem- onstrated just how important other scientists considered this break- through. Kornberg and colleagues isolated an enzyme from E. coli that catalyzes the covalent addition of nucleotides to preexisting DNA chains. Initially called DNA polymerase or “Kornberg’s enzyme,” this enzyme is now known as DNA polymerase I because of the subse- quent discovery of several other DNA polymerases in E. coli.
Over many years Kornberg and colleagues carried out exten- sive in vitro studies on the mechanism by which this enzyme cata- lyzed the synthesis of DNA, and much of what we know about DNA polymerases is based on their results. DNA polymerase I requires the 5-triphosphates of each of the four deoxyribonucleosides— deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), deoxythymidine triphosphate
(dTTP), deoxyguanosine triphosphate (dGTP), and deoxycytidine tri- phosphate (dCTP)—and is active only in the presence of Mg2 ions and preexisting DNA. This DNA must be at least partially double-stranded and partially single-stranded, and must contain a free 3-hydroxyl (3-OH) group. The enzyme catalyzes the addition of nucleotides to the 3-OH group of preexisting DNA strands. Therefore, it catalyzes the covalent extension of DNA chains in only the 5 → 3 direction.
DNA polymerase I is a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of 103,000 encoded by a gene called polA. However, DNA polymerase I is not the true “DNA replicase” in E. coli. In 1969, Paula DeLucia and John Cairns reported that DNA replication occurred in an E. coli strain lacking the polymerase activity of DNA polymerase I due to a mutation in the polA gene. However, DeLucia and Cairns also discovered that this polA1 mutant was extremely sensitive to ultraviolet light (UV). We now know that a major function of DNA polymerase I in E. coli is to repair defects in DNA, such as those induced by UV (Chapter 13). However, as we will see later in this chapter (Initiation of DNA Chains with RNA Primers), DNA poly- merase I also plays an important role in chromosome replication.
Today, in vitro studies are being used to characterize DNA polymerases in many different organisms. Several recently dis- covered polymerases, called translesion polymerases, because they can replicate past lesions or defects in DNA that block rep- lication by most polymerases, are proving especially interesting. In humans and other mammals, DNA polymerase eta () plays an important role in replicating damaged DNA. Individuals who are homozygous for loss-of-function mutations in the POLH gene (also called the XPV gene) that encodes polymerase  have one form of an inherited disorder called xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). Individuals with XP are extremely sensitive to sunlight; they develop multiple skin cancers after exposure to UV in sunlight (see Chapter 13).
CONTINUOUS SYNTHESIS OF ONE STRAND; DISCONTINUOUS SYNTHESIS
OF THE OTHER STRAND
As previously discussed, the two nascent DNA strands being synthesized at each replicating fork are being extended in the same direction at the macromo- lecular level. Because the complementary strands of a DNA double helix have opposite chemical polarity, one strand is being extended in an overall 5 → 3 direction and the other strand is being extended in an overall 3 → 5 direc- tion ( Figure 10.13a). But DNA polymerases can only catalyze synthesis in the 5 → 3 direction. This paradox was resolved with the demonstration that the synthesis of one strand of DNA is continuous, whereas synthesis of the other strand is discontinuous. At the molecular level, synthesis of the complementary strands of DNA is occurring in opposite physical directions ( Figure 10.13b), but both new strands are extended in the same 5 → 3 chemical direction. The synthesis of the strand being extended in the overall 5 → 3 direction, called the leading strand, is continuous. The strand being extended in the overall 3 → 5 direction, called the lagging strand, grows by the synthesis of short frag- ments (synthesized 5 → 3) and the subsequent covalent joining of these short frag- ments. Thus, the synthesis of the lagging strand occurs by a discontinuous mechanism.
The first evidence for this discontinuous mode of DNA replication came from studies in which intermediates in DNA synthesis were radioactively labeled by grow- ing E. coli cells and bacteriophage T4-infected E. coli cells for very short periods of time in medium containing 3H-thymidine (pulse-labeling experiments). The labeled DNAs were then isolated, denatured, and characterized by measuring their veloc- ity of sedimentation through sucrose gradients during high-speed centrifugation. When E. coli cells were pulse-labeled for 5, 10, or 30 seconds, for example, much of the label was found in small fragments of DNA, 1000 to 2000 nucleotides long ( Figure 10.13c). These small fragments of DNA have been named Okazaki frag- ments after Reiji Okazaki and Tuneko Okazaki, the scientists who discovered them in the late 1960s. In eukaryotes, the Okazaki fragments are only 100 to 200 nucleotides in length. When longer pulse-labeling periods are used, more of the label is recovered in large DNA molecules, presumably the size of E. coli or phage T4 chromosomes. If cells are pulse-labeled with 3H-thymidine for a short period and then are transferred to nonradioactive medium for an extended period of growth (pulse-chase experi- ments), the labeled thymidine is present in chromosome-size DNA molecules. The results of these pulse-chase experiments are important because they indicate that the Okazaki fragments are true intermediates in DNA replication and not some type of metabolic by-product.
COVALENT CLOSURE OF NICKS IN DNA BY DNA LIGASE
If the lagging strand of DNA is synthesized discontinuously as described in the preced- ing section, a mechanism is needed to link the Okazaki fragments together to produce the large DNA strands present in mature chromosomes. This mechanism is provided by the enzyme DNA ligase. DNA ligase catalyzes the covalent closure of nicks (missing phosphodiester linkages; no missing bases) in DNA molecules by using energy from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) or adenosine triphosphate (ATP). The E. coli DNA ligase uses NAD as a cofactor, but some DNA ligases use ATP. The reaction catalyzed by DNA ligase is shown in  Figure 10.14. First, AMP of the ligase-AMP intermediate forms a phosphoester linkage with the 5-phosphate at the nick, and then a nucleophilic attack by the 3-OH at the nick on the DNA-proximal phosphorus atom produces a phosphodiester linkage between the adjacent nucleotides at the site of the nick. DNA ligase alone has no activity at breaks in DNA where one or more nucleotides are missing—so-called gaps. Gaps can be filled in and sealed only by the combined action of a DNA polymerase and DNA ligase. DNA ligase plays an essential role not only in DNA replication, but also in DNA repair and recombination (Chapter 13).
INITIATION OF DNA REPLICATION
The replication of the E. coli chromosome begins at oriC, the unique sequence at which replication is initiated, with the formation of a localized region of strand separation called the replication bubble. This replication bubble is formed by the interaction of prepriming proteins with oriC ( Figure 10.15). The first step in prepriming appears to be the binding of four molecules of the dnaA gene product—DnaA protein—to the four 9-base-pair (bp) repeats in oriC. Next, DnaA proteins bind cooperatively to form a core of 20 to 40 polypeptides with oriC DNA wound on the surface of the protein complex. Strand separation begins within the three tandem 13-bp repeats in oriC and spreads until the replication bubble is created. A complex of DnaB protein (the hexameric DNA helicase) and DnaC protein (six molecules) joins the initiation complex and contributes to the formation of two bidi- rectional replication forks. The DnaT protein also is present in the prepriming protein complex, but its function is unknown. Other proteins associated with the initiation complex at oriC are DnaJ protein, DnaK protein, PriA protein, PriB protein, PriC protein, DNA-binding protein HU, DNA gyrase, and single-strand DNA- binding (SSB) protein. In some cases, however, their functional involvement in the prepriming process has not been established; in other cases, they are known to be involved, but their roles are unknown. The DnaA protein appears to be largely responsible for the localized strand separation at oriC during the initiation process.
INITIATION OF DNA CHAINS WITH RNA PRIMERS
All known DNA polymerases have an absolute requirement for a free 3-OH on the end of the DNA strand being extended and an appro- priate DNA template strand (specifying the complementary nascent strand) for activity. No known DNA polymerase can initiate the syn- thesis of a new strand of DNA. Thus, some special mechanism must exist to initiate or prime the synthesis of new DNA chains once a replication bubble has formed.
RNA polymerase, a complex enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of RNA molecules from DNA templates, has long been known to be capable of initiating the synthesis of new RNA chains at specific sites on the DNA. When this occurs, an RNA-DNA hybrid is formed in which the nascent RNA is hydrogen bonded to the DNA template. Because DNA polymerases are capable of extending either DNA or RNA chains containing a free 3-OH, scientists began testing the idea that DNA synthesis might be initiated by using RNA primers. Their results proved that this idea is correct.
Subsequent research demonstrated that each new DNA chain is initiated by a short RNA primer synthesized by DNA primase ( Figure 10.16). The E. coli DNA primase is the product of the dnaG gene. In prokaryotes, these RNA primers are 10 to 60 nucleotides long, whereas in eukaryotes they are shorter, only about 10 nucleotides long. The RNA primers provide the free 3-OHs required for covalent extension of polynucleotide chains by DNA polymerases. In E. coli, the enzyme that catalyzes the semiconservative replication of the chromosome is a poly- merase called DNA polymerase III (see the section Multiple DNA Polymerases and Proofreading). DNA polymerase III catalyzes the addition of deoxyribonucleotides to RNA primers, either continuously on the leading strand or discontinuously by the synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand. DNA polymerase III ter- minates an Okazaki fragment when it bumps into the RNA primer of the preceding Okazaki fragment.
The RNA primers subsequently are excised and replaced with DNA chains. This step is accomplished by DNA polymerase I in E. coli. In addition to the 5 → 3 polymerase activity illustrated in Figure 10.12, DNA polymerase I possesses two exo- nuclease activities: a 5 → 3 exonuclease activity, which cuts back DNA strands starting at 5 termini, and a 3 → 5 exonuclease activity, which cleaves off nucleotides from the 3 termini of DNA strands. Therefore, DNA polymerase I contains three distinct enzyme activities ( Figure 10.17), and all three activities play important roles in the replication of the E. coli chromosome.
The 5 → 3 exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I excises the RNA primer, and, at the same time, the 5 → 3 polymerase activity of the enzyme replaces the RNA with a DNA chain by using the adjacent Okazaki fragment with its free 3-OH as a primer. As we might expect based on this mechanism of primer replacement, E. coli polA mutants that lack the 5 → 3 exonuclease activity of DNA polymerase I are defective in the excision of RNA primers and the joining of Okazaki fragments. After DNA polymerase I has replaced the RNA primer with a DNA chain, the 3-OH of one Okazaki fragment is next to the 5-phosphate group of the preceding Okazaki fragment. This product is an appropriate substrate for DNA ligase, which catalyzes the formation of a phosphodiester linkage between the adjacent Okazaki fragments.
The steps involved in the synthesis and replacement of RNA primers during the discontinuous replication of the lagging strand are illustrated in  Figure 10.18.
UNWINDING DNA WITH HELICASES, DNA-BINDING PROTEINS, AND TOPOISOMERASES
Semiconservative replication requires that the two strands of a parental DNA molecule be separated during the synthesis of new complementary strands. Since a DNA double helix contains two strands that cannot be separated without untwisting them turn by turn, DNA replication requires an unwinding mechanism. Given that each gyre, or turn, is about 10 nucleotide pairs long, a DNA molecule must be rotated 360 once for each 10 replicated base pairs. In E. coli, DNA replicates at a rate of about 30,000 nucleotides per minute. Thus, a replicating DNA molecule must spin at 3000 revolutions per minute to facilitate the unwinding of the parental DNA strands. The unwinding process ( Figure 10.19a) involves enzymes called DNA helicases. The major replicative DNA helicase in E. coli is the product of the dnaB gene. DNA helicases unwind DNA molecules using energy derived from ATP.
Once the DNA strands are unwound by DNA helicase, they must be kept in an extended single-stranded form for replication. They are maintained in this state by a coating of single-strand DNA-binding protein (SSB protein) ( Figure 10.19b). The binding of SSB protein to single-stranded DNA is cooperative; that is, the binding of the first SSB monomer stimulates the binding of additional monomers at contiguous sites on the DNA chain. Because of the cooperativity of SSB protein binding, an entire single-stranded region of DNA is rapidly coated with SSB protein. Without the SSB protein coating, the complementary strands could renature or form intrastrand hairpin structures by hydrogen bonding between short segments of complementary or partially complementary nucleotide sequences. Such hairpin structures are known to impede the activity of DNA polymerases. In E. coli, the SSB protein is encoded by the ssb gene.
Recall that the E. coli chromosome contains a circular molecule of DNA. With the E. coli DNA spinning at 3000 revolutions per minute to allow the unwinding of the parental strands during replication ( Figure 10.20), what provides the swivel or axis of rotation that prevents the DNA from becoming tangled (positively supercoiled) ahead of the replication fork? The required axes of rotation during the replication of circular DNA molecules are provided by enzymes called DNA topoisomerases. The topoisomerases catalyze transient breaks in DNA molecules but use covalent linkages to themselves to hold on to the cleaved molecules. The topoisomerases are of two types: (1) DNA topoisomerase I enzymes produce temporary single-strand breaks or nicks in DNA, and (2) DNA topoisomerase II enzymes produce transient double- strand breaks in DNA. An important result of this difference is that topoisomerase I activities remove supercoils from DNA one at a time, whereas topoisomerase II enzymes remove and introduce supercoils two at a time.
The transient single-strand break produced by the activity of topoisomerase I provides an axis of rotation that allows the segments of DNA on opposite sides of the break to spin independently, with the phosphodiester bond in the intact strand serv- ing as a swivel ( Figure 10.21). Topoisomerase I enzymes are energy-efficient. They conserve the energy of the cleaved phosphodiester linkages by storing it in covalent linkages between themselves and the phosphate groups at the cleavage sites; they then reuse this energy to reseal the breaks.
DNA topoisomerase II enzymes induce transient double-strand breaks and add negative supercoils or remove positive supercoils two at a time by an energy (ATP)-requiring mechanism. They carry out this process by cutting both strands of DNA, holding on to the ends at the cleavage site via covalent bonds, passing the intact double helix through the cut, and resealing the break ( Figure 10.22). In addition to relaxing supercoiled DNA and introducing negative supercoils into DNA, topoisom- erase II enzymes can separate interlocking circular molecules of DNA.
The best-characterized type II topoisomerase is an enzyme named DNA gyrase in E. coli. DNA gyrase is a tetramer with two  subunits encoded by the gyrA gene (originally nalA, for nalidixic acid) and two  subunits specified by the gyrB gene (formerly cou, for coumermycin). Nalidixic acid and coumermycin are antibiotics that block DNA replica- tion in E. coli by inhibiting the activity of DNA gyrase. Nalidixic acid and coumermycin inhibit DNA synthesis by binding to the  and  subunits, respectively, of DNA gyrase. Thus, DNA gyrase activity is required for DNA replication to occur in E. coli.
Recall that chromosomal DNA is negatively supercoiled in E. coli (Chapter 9). The negative supercoils in bacterial chromosomes are introduced by DNA gyrase, with energy supplied by ATP. This activity of DNA gyrase provides another solution to the unwinding problem. Instead of creating positive supercoils ahead of the replica- tion fork by unwinding the complementary strands of relaxed DNA, replication may produce relaxed DNA ahead of the fork by unwinding negatively supercoiled DNA. Because superhelical tension is reduced during unwinding—that is, strand separation is energetically favored—the negative supercoiling behind the fork may drive the unwinding process. If so, this mechanism nicely explains why DNA gyrase activity is required for DNA replication in bacteria. Alternatively, gyrase may simply remove positive supercoils that form ahead of the replication fork.
MULTIPLE DNA POLYMERASES AND PROOFREADING
DNA polymerases are processive enzymes that catalyze the covalent extension at the 3 termini of growing polynucleotide chains. All polymerases require preexisting DNA
